          <p>I hereby certify that the data I have given in this form are true and correct and that I have read and will abide all the SRA published rules & regulations governing schedule and refund of fees. My withdrawal/dropping from this school or transfer to another school after the first 10 days of classes does not release me of my responsibility to settle the unpaid balance of my fees for the whole school year.</p>
          <p>I agree that my enrolment will be cancelled if I have enrolled under false pretense and with irregular credentials or fail to submit the above records on time.  I agree to be banned from readmission for reasons of poor scholastic standing and/or conduct of unbecoming of a student violative of the school rules and regulations. Furthermore, dismissal under such circumstances will not be considered ground for reduction of any financial obligation or a refund. </p>
